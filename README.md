GeoCAT-comp is both the whole computational component of the [GeoCAT](https://ncar.github.io/GeoCAT) 
project and a single Github repository as described here. As the computational component of 
[GeoCAT](https://ncar.github.io/GeoCAT), GeoCAT-comp provides implementations of computational functions for operating 
on geosciences data. Many of these functions originated in NCL and were translated into Python with the help of GeoCAT-comp; 
however, developers are welcome to come up with novel computational functions for geosciences data.

Many of the computational functions in GeoCAT are implemented in a pure Python fashion. However, 
there are some others that are implemented in Fortran but wrapped up in Python. To facilitate 
contribution, the whole GeoCAT-comp structure is split into two repositories with respect to 
being pure-Python or Python with compiled codes (i.e. Fortran) implementations. Such implementation 
layers are handled within [GeoCAT-comp](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-comp) and 
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) repositories, respectively (The 
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) repo is documented on its own).


# GeoCAT-comp

GeoCAT-comp repo does not explicitly contain or require any compiled code, making it more 
accessible to the general Python community at large. However, if 
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py) is installed, then all functions contained in 
the "geocat.f2py" package are imported seamlessly into the "geocat.comp" namespace. Thus, 
GeoCAT-comp repo serves as a user API to access the entire computational toolkit even though the 
repo itself only contains pure Python code from the contributorâ€™s perspective. Whenever prospective 
contributors want to add new computational functionality implemented as pure Python, GeoCAT-comp 
is the repo to do so. Therefore, there is no onus on contributors of pure python code to 
build/compile/test any compiled code (i.e. Fortran) at GeoCAT-comp level.

# Xarray interface vs NumPy interface

GeoCAT-comp provides a high-level [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) interface under the 
`geocat.comp` namespace. However, a stripped-down NumPy interface is used under the hood to bridge 
the gap between NumPy arrays and the compiled language data structures used by 
[GeoCAT-f2py](https://github.com/NCAR/geocat-f2py). These functions are accessible under the 
`geocat.comp` namespace, but are minimally documented and are 
intended primarily for internal use.
