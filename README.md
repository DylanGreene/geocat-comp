geocat-comp
===========

GeoCAT-comp is the computational component of the [GeoCAT](https://ncar.github.io/GeoCAT) project. GeoCAT-comp wraps NCL's non-WRF Fortran routines into Python.

GeoCAT-comp depends on a separate C/Fortran library called "[ncomp](https://github.com/NCAR/ncomp)", which contains these Fortran routines.
